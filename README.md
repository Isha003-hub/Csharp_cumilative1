# School Database MVP - CRUD Operations for Teachers, Students, and Courses
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using ASP.NET Core Web API and MVC. It manages data for teachers, students, and courses within a school database. The core objective is to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that supports efficient data management through API endpoints and dynamic web pages.

---
## Features
## Comprehensive CRUD Operations
Enables users to create, read, update, and delete records for teachers, students, and courses.
Accessible via APIs and dynamic web pages.

# Data Validation and Integrity
## Implements error handling for:
Invalid entries (e.g., future dates or missing required fields).
Duplicate identifiers.

# Relational Database Integration
## Utilizes MySQL with well-structured relationships, ensuring data consistency across:
Teachers
Students
Courses

# Testing and Validation
Comprehensive testing ensures the proper functionality of each CRUD operation. Evidence is provided through cURL commands and web page interaction screenshots. Key testing scenarios include:

## Adding Records
Validate correct data input and database insertion.

## Reading Records
Ensure accurate retrieval and display of teacher, student, and course data.

## Updating Records
Confirm proper updates of teacher, student, and course information in the database.

## Deleting Records
Verify deletion process, including handling of non-existent records.

## Usability
Target Audience: Educational institutions or developers managing academic data.

## Purpose: A tool for learning and understanding:
Core concepts in web development.
Database interaction.
Object-oriented programming (OOP).
Learning Objectives
CRUD Operations Mastery

## Implement CRUD functionality for three distinct data models:
Teachers
Students
Courses

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
Apply encapsulation, property management, and modular class structures to ensure clarity and scalability.
Database Integration

Use relational database principles, incorporating foreign key relationships between Courses and Teachers.
