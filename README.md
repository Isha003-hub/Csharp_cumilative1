# Project Overview
This C# project demonstrates CRUD operations through the management of Teacher objects, making it a practical tool for learning object-oriented programming.

## Key Features
**Teacher Class:** Manages data attributes like TeacherId, TeacherFName, TeacherLName, TeacherHireDate, EmployeeNumber, and TeacherSalary.
**OOP Implementation:** Applies encapsulation and properties to ensure data integrity and readability.
**Data Handling:** Facilitates creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting teacher records.

## Use Case
Designed for educational institutions and developers, this project is an ideal resource for exploring OOP and CRUD principles in a real-world context, offering a hands-on learning experience for new developers and students.

# School Database MVP: CRUD Operations for Teachers, Students, and Courses**

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for managing data related to teachers, students, and courses within a school environment. Built using ASP.NET Core Web API and MVC, the application provides comprehensive functionality for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) via both dynamic web pages and API endpoints.

**## Key Features**
Complete CRUD Functionality: Allows users to manage teachers, students, and courses efficiently through interactive web interfaces and APIs.
Data Validation and Integrity: Ensures error-free entries by validating data such as preventing duplicate identifiers, disallowing future dates, and handling missing fields.
Relational Database Support: Integrates with MySQL, implementing structured relationships between entities to maintain data consistency and integrity.
Testing and Validation
Robust testing has been incorporated to verify the functionality of all CRUD operations, with evidence provided in the form of cURL commands and web page interaction screenshots. Testing ensures:

**## Adding Records:** Proper validation of inputs and successful database storage.
**## Retrieving Records:** Accurate retrieval and display of data for teachers, students, and courses.
**## Deleting Records:** Safe deletion with confirmation and appropriate handling of invalid or non-existent entries.

**## Usability**
This application is ideal for educational institutions aiming to manage academic data effectively or for developers exploring web development principles. It serves as a learning tool to understand key aspects of web application development, database management, and object-oriented programming (OOP).

**## Learning Objectives**
**## Mastering CRUD Operations:** Implement and optimize CRUD functionalities for three distinct data models: Teachers, Students, and Courses.
**## Practical Application of OOP Principles:** Utilize encapsulation, property management, and modular class structures to enhance scalability and maintainability.
**## Database Integration Skills:** Design and interact with a relational database using foreign key relationships, particularly between Courses and Teachers.

**## Relational Database Integration:**
The project employs MySQL to maintain data consistency and integrity. Relationships are structured with appropriate use of foreign keys, ensuring a seamless connection between teachers, courses, and students.

This project not only demonstrates the technical expertise required to build a functional school database but also highlights the importance of good software design practices and testing.
